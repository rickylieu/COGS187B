                        <p>The Student Affirmative Action Committee (SAAC), formed in 1975, is a UC San Diego student coalition committed to upholding the principles of educational equity and opposing institutional oppression. SAAC is dedicated to fighting ignorance, addressing the issues confronting historically underrepresented and/or underserved students and promoting cross-cultural awareness and communication by strengthening the bonds between students and organizations. Core members of SAAC include the Asian and Pacific-Islander Student Alliance (APSA), Black Student Union (BSU), Kaibigang Pilipin@ (KP), Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlan (MEChA), Muslim Student Association (MSA), Native American Student Alliance (NASA), Queer People of Color (QPOC), and Students with Disabilities Coalition (SDC).<br><br>

                        As a Student Affirmative Action Committee (SAAC) organization and a core organization of the Student Promoted Access Center for Education and Service (SPACES), KP strives to provide underprivileged communities with the resources they need to access higher education, assist in the retention and matriculation of underprivileged students within the undergraduate population, and educate and spread awareness concerning the struggle and sociopolitical issues of the Pilipin@ and Pilipin@-American community.</p>

                        <p>In the mid-1990s, the shrinking numbers of students from under-represented groups and a national climate increasingly hostile to people of color strained race relations on campus. A coalition of student of color organizations (including KP) and other concerned students, staff, and faculty began to insist more forcefully on the need for a Cross-Cultural Center. After town meetings and demonstrations, a task force/Chancellor steering committee was formed and the Cross-Cultural Center officially opened in 1995.<br><br>

                          The UCSD Cross-Cultural Center is dedicated to supporting the needs of UCSD’s diverse student, staff and faculty communities. Our mission is to create a learning environment in which the entire campus community feels welcome. Within this charge, and in collaboration with existing campus programs, the Cross-Cultural Center’s priority is to:<br></p>

                          <ol>
                            <li>Facilitate the academic, professional and personal development of students, staff and faculty who are members of historically under-represented groups.</li>
                            <li>Provide programs and services to foster discussions on issues related to the creation of a multi-ethnic, culturally conscious university.</li>
                          </ol><br>
                          <p>The Affiliate Program is designed to develop more collaborative and long-lasting relationships with groups, departments, and organizations who share our mission and philosophy. We aim to connect with our affiliates and to provide them with resources around their social justice efforts. Some benefits of affiliating include priority room reservations, increased co-sponsorship funding opportunities, advertising through CCC media, and trainings from our Diversity Peer Educators.</p>
